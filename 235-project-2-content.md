# Project 2 Documentation
## Overview

Can I Afford Bananas is a web service application that determines 
the amount of money it will cost to buy 'X' lbs of bananas. The 
application determines if you can afford the bananas from 
the input of how many bananas you asked for, what currency you 
want to use and how much of that currency you have.

# Proposal
## I. High Concept

Users can play around with the various numbers and currency inputs 
to educate themselves with how much bananas cost in other countries.

## II. Genre

Web Service Application


## III. Platform

Can I afford bananas is a web-based application

## IV. Esthetics

The color scheme is laid back and tame where the content is a blend of 
yellows and grays, and the background is a mish-mash of various bananas 
images.

## V. Gameplay

### Mechanics

A number input for the number of lbs the user wants. A drop down menu 
for the currency the user wants to use. A number input for the amount 
of money the person has. Finally a radio button for if you want to 
buy the bananas or not. Once those inputs are complete a button to 
display the results will do so.
