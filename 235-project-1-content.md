## IX. About the Developer

My name is Brayden Wachowiak--if you can pronounce my last name then you surely are
one in a million. Despite the constant butchering of my last, I still manage to get
a kick out of the creative pronunciations people come up with. I grew up in a
relatively small town of about 26,000 people in Minnesota. I'm a 2nd Year Game Design 
Student, which I guess means I love video games. When it comes to sports,
soccer is undoubtedly my favorite sport. It may be a bit biased for me to say, but I
would go as far to say it's the best sport. I played it from the age of 5 till my
senior year of high school, and even into intramurals in college.

# Documentation

All of the art/sprites and code were do by myself with the help of W3Schools.
